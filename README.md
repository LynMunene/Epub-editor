A powerful, client-side, single-page application (SPA) for professionally editing EPUB files, built entirely with **HTML, CSS (Android 15 Dark Theme), and Vanilla JavaScript**.

The editor allows users to load an EPUB file, perform common fixes and edits, and download the modified file—all without server-side processing.

## ✨ Features

This editor is designed to streamline the EPUB preparation process with a focus on fixing common metadata and structural issues.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Metadata Editing** | Modify core EPUB metadata like **Title**, **Author**, **Language**, and **Publisher**. |
| **Cover Replacement** | Easily replace the cover image, with automatic updates to the OPF manifest (`item` and `<meta name="cover">`). |
| **Cover Structure Fix** | Option to **Ensure cover is the first item in spine order** to correct reading flow. |
| **Front Page Generator** | **Add Front Page** feature to automatically create a simple XHTML wrapper for the cover image and insert it as the first spine item if a proper cover wrapper is missing. |
| **Table of Contents (TOC)** | **Generate/Replace TOC (NCX)** by scanning chapter files using a customizable **CSS Selector** (e.g., `h1, h2, .chapter-title`). |
| **Bulk Find & Replace** | Apply multiple, non-global, or **RegEx** based text replacement rules across *all* chapter (XHTML/HTML) files in the EPUB package. |
| **Client-Side Only** | All processing is done locally in the browser for **speed and privacy**. |
| **Modern UI** | Utilizes an **Android 15 Dark Theme** inspired design for a clean and focused experience. |
